# Animon-Final
Final product of a group project: Basically a Tomagatchi Clone

Create a pet, give it a name, and be sure to take care of them. 

You're able to play, clean, feed, and compete with your pet. Earn money to buy items needed
to look out for your furry friend. If you don't feed your pet for instance, they'll be too hungry to play games with you.
